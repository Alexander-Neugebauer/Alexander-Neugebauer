Hello there! 

My name is Alexander, I'm a Post-Doctoral researcher at the University of Tübingen with a focus on Medical Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies, Serious Games, and VR/AR.

I'm currently working on a Virtual-Reality based visual rehabilitation software for patients with peripheral visual field defects.

In addition, I'm interested in all things game design and game development.
